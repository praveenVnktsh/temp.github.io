Have you gone through the same process as me?

Of wondering about purpose in life. Sometimes looking at life with amazement and astonishment. Being greatly touched by its beauty. Admiring intricate patterns on leaves on those long walks on the mountains or sometimes just staring at the plant in the balcony. Gazing at the colours of the wings on the Butterfly and being mesmerised by the textures on a flower. I have been saddened by the behaviour of people close to me and deeply humbled by looking at the spirit of human beings. When I see people who own less things giving more and people who go through suffering, comfort more.

Then comes a stage when you understand that the people who are making fun of others suffering, have not gone through it themselves. So you don’t even want to be angry with them. “They are ignorant!”you tell your self. One day, they will understand. Today they think that are in a powerful position and protected. Let that be. Thank God that rich people cannot buy health and life. At least some where,God has been fair.

Sometimes, some people are big achievers. They set goals one after the other. They achieve their targets and they get recognition. They get rewarded. They are rewarded in society for their contribution, in monetary terms and for their work.

Some people are happy to just support other people. What have you achieved mum? asks my son. Hmm my achievement is….that hmmm you and your brother have turned up well. You both are such good children. I supported your Dad well, and I have been happy!. That’s all. You are right mum, everybody need not achieve, he says.

Well then, for me I find happiness in little things. It could be having a cup of tea. Having a conversation with my mum, interaction with colleague, giving myself a positive self talk. As long as I am thinking of good thoughts about other people and about bringing the good out in the open and admiring it!
