> Have you ever Floated in water? It is the most wonderful feeling you will ever get. You feel free!!! You do not have a worry for sometime. You leave all your control and just relax in the moment. The water carries all your weight. For those brief moments you close your eyes and you can be in your own Paradise, someone may fancy a beach house, someone else may want a cottage by the mountain. Each person is unique and different.

> A human being wants so much control. We want everything to go according to our plan. We forget that we were born not knowing anything. It was only when we became conscious of who were are that we realised that yes, we are living on this planet Earth.We have been given Parents who look after us, we are being educated.

When a child is conceived, the child grows automatically in its mothers womb. Anybody from outside cannot control it. There is a higher power or intelligence who is doing this. Many people are still not ready to accept that there is a higher power. People who have seen magic in their lives will only believe that there are unknown forces at work. We neither Planned our coming nor will we plan our exit. What we do in between with the time we have here will be important. 

When a child grows beautifully in a mothers womb, after it comes out, the relatives and Parents want full control of the child.They forget that the child has its own personality. They can be facilitators but they cannot own their own children. Some people become very arrogant and proud. They start controlling their children. They love to show how much the children listen to them, by putting restrictions on them. That relationship of fear is never healthy.

Even Parents are not sure of many of the answers of Life. It is better to tell the children the truth.Let the children think for themselves.

Our schools address subjects that we may never use but they do not address topics that we may need when we are little. Those questions are about Life, Living, Death. Talking openly about things makes sense.

If a child is thinking about all these questions, then they consider the child not as a sensitive soul but someone who needs some fine tuning. They say Why do you want to talk about such things?  Children should be given answers so that they do not have to wonder. They are very good at accepting reality.

These questions about how we came into existence are real questions. They came to mind when I was in Kindergarten. Nobody had the answer.These questions are very important and should be a part of the curriculum. The one important thing Kids need to be told that

1.Nobody can die of thinking.

2  Don't be afraid of your thoughts.

3.Your thoughts are separate from you. You can observe them coming and going. Dont analyse them. Just watch them.

4. Instead we have mums getting angry at their children, and calling them problem givers. This makes the children feel sad about themselves. Probably mums and Dads don't know the answer. Even if the mother and Father have a different answer, the child can be told that mum and Dad have different answers but you can find out your answer and there is no rush for that.

5. Children need gentle guidance. They need to be told that there is nothing to be worried about. This happens to everybody. 
6. A big part of curriculum which is missing is " Who am I? There can be different interpretations but we do not need to go to different religions for that. We can explain to the children, that at this time they are so and so born in this family. They will learn, Play, grow here. Then they will make good choices, spread the love.
7. We should be saying " You are supported! " You are Loved!: Dont be afraid of anything, the universe has your back!!
