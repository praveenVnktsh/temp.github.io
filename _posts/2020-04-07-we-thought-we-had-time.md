And we thought......\
We had all the time in the world,\
to be just a little self centred\
to buy just that one more car\
and that new sofa...\
What about that new ripped jeans\
And get the balayage done\
Or maybe a new coat this winter\
Travel the high seas\
See New York, Egypt and Greece!\
\
Hey but what about the soul's desire?\
to do something for inner peace\
to write a book\
Which the world could use

To be there for someone abused\
\
I shall do that one day\
When I have my share\
Of my heart's desires!\
Then I will do something for the community\
Sit and write letters to my friends and do things that are not for me but for others!\
\
Say a kind word to my mum\
Write a loving note to my husband\
Tell my kids how much I love them\
Tell my grand daughter she makes my day!\
But we do not know what is going to happen in the next hour!\
All we have is just this moment now\
\
We used to have so much time before.....\
But now,\
Waves of uncertainty\
Crash through my door

\
Why worry my friend\
There is still time for more

For the next moment is still mine!\
I can seize it and live it for my purpose\
And find truly what my heart wants to do\
\
So when I go to my real home\
I don't have to carry a thing\
I land there with happiness and joy\
And my earth family says\
" It was God's will!"\
She was happy and fulfilled!\
Doing what her heart desired!\
\
And this lesson was learnt by humanity.....\
To value what we have\
Is here and now\
To do what is possible this moment now\
Not wait for the perfect weather, time, clothes\
Just do it now!\
Quickly\
Tick it off\
Things you want to say\
Skills you want to learn\
Stories you want to share\
And tell the world\
Finish your paintings\
Do your dancing\
Marry your soulmate\
Don't you waste time\
\
Focus on what is important\
Conserve your energy for meaningful things in life\
The secret is to give\
And not take\
\
Travel light through the journey of life\
So you can hop off anytime you are asked to\
Why carry the burdens\
Of being a victim\
Shed off the perception\
That you thought\
What others were thinking\
Because others were too immersed\
In their own little dreams\
To judge you and say mean things.\
\
Shake it off and walk away!\
For there is no time to waste\
The virus may strike any day!\
