I love my granddaughter a lot and want to make sure that she has something to read if I don’t survive this uncertain pandemic. I want to tell her that her Dadi had a very happy childhood. Lot of cousins to play with. Life was predictable. There were many people who made me feel safe. Besides my parents,
there was my “Aai"my neighbour. Her name was Shobha Mhatre. She had many qualities. She did not have any kids and they had been married for 12 yrs. Aai had lot of patience and love to give me. Aai gave me her time. Our relationship was selfless, without measuring how much we gave each other.As a child I was very soft spoken and full of love for people who loved me. I was very compassionate and
kind. Any distress that I saw, bothered me. It made me sad. It would make me sad for days. I was often told that it was not right to be like that. I had to be strong. Why, I don’t know. After growing up and trying to less emotional ( which never happened) , I came to the conclusion:


 ***What your heart says is always right.***

**It is good to be loving and kind. Love freely, express your love.** **People think love and kindness is a sign of weakness, it is not. In fact success is not measured by money, or degrees. It can be equated to how deeply and genuinely you have cared for people.**  ***You are unique and only you can be you***. Never be shy of expressing yourself. No matter what anybody says, listen to your inner voice. You will know which one it is. It is not dominating, this
voice and it always makes you happy.
 **Do *things that make you happy***. Life is not a punishment. When we were in school, we were caned for no reason and I was very fragile and little to understand that they were doing this to control the large
numbers of children. They wanted to instill discipline by creating fear in the minds of children. That affected my self esteem. I struggled with it all my life. I always felt that other people were right. Then when I started reading about spirituality and awoke to the real truth. When your grandfather, or asked me to do things on my own, I started getting more and more confident.
 ***Your values will guide you***: Always stand for what you believe in, even if the whole world is against you. But that does not mean that you create dis harmony wherever you go to prove a point.
Example: You know that treating people with respect is a basic value, so don’t be a bystander when someone is insulting another person and denying that person a basic human right.

 ***Know that you are loved!*** You are loved, by your parents, your grandparents, extended family, and by the universal energy. I would say that my father in heaven loves me but for some other
people who do not believe in God, it might be a loving energy .

 ***Dream*** : Feel free to dream big and all your dreams will come true and some things that will happen will be been better than your dreams.

 **Accept imperfections** in yourself and others: You may find that people you love like your friends, cousins, even parents, grandparents are
flawed. They may be good in one way but you may not like some things about them. That’s fine,
you can still love them, remembering that even you are not perfect.
 I have so many dreams of playing with you. You know the little miniature grocery things I
collected  for you, was even before you came in your mum’s tummy.
Your chacha loves you soon much. Dada and me love you too. I want to watch you grow. Have
many holidays with you. I want to come and stay with you in a school term, I want to listen to
your talk about your day when you come back from school. I want you to sleep next to me and I
want to read so many stories to you.

  ***Its O.K to not know the answer,*** the future or to not know what decision to take. Anyway sometimes there is no right answers but we make choices. Just wait and the answers will come. Earth is a school where we come to learn.If they don't just follow your intuition. At the most , you will make mistakes but you will learn from your mistakes.et’s hope for the best and trust all will be well!

***You cannot please everybody*** so first be true to ourself, then be nice to others. If they don' reciprocate, they are bad mannered.

When our loved ones pass away, we feel sad. But remember that we are always connected. Love is eternal. A thought away. You can still send love and i send love to my Dad, my grand parents. I feel like they guide me. We will meet again. We will meet in another life and we will be near each other because **we are all connected!**
