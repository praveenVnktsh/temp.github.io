<p>And we thought‚Ä¶‚Ä¶<br />
We had all the time in the world,<br />
to be just a little self centred<br />
to buy just that one more car<br />
and that new sofa‚Ä¶<br />
What about that new ripped jeans<br />
And get the balayage done<br />
Or maybe a new coat this winter<br />
Travel the high seas<br />
See New York, Egypt and Greece!<br />
<br />
Hey but what about the soul‚Äôs desire?<br />
to do something for inner peace<br />
to write a book<br />
Which the world could use</p>

<p>To be there for someone abused<br />
<br />
I shall do that one day<br />
When I have my share<br />
Of my heart‚Äôs desires!<br />
Then I will do something for the community<br />
Sit and write letters to my friends and do things that are not for me but for others!<br />
<br />
Say a kind word to my mum<br />
Write a loving note to my husband<br />
Tell my kids how much I love them<br />
Tell my grand daughter she makes my day!<br />
But we do not know what is going to happen in the next hour!<br />
All we have is just this moment now<br />
<br />
We used to have so much time before‚Ä¶..<br />
But now,<br />
Waves of uncertainty<br />
Crash through my door</p>

<p><br />
Why worry my friend<br />
There is still time for more</p>

<p>For the next moment is still mine!<br />
I can seize it and live it for my purpose<br />
And find truly what my heart wants to do<br />
<br />
So when I go to my real home<br />
I don‚Äôt have to carry a thing<br />
I land there with happiness and joy<br />
And my earth family says<br />
‚Äú It was God‚Äôs will!‚Äù<br />
She was happy and fulfilled!<br />
Doing what her heart desired!<br />
<br />
And this lesson was learnt by humanity‚Ä¶..<br />
To value what we have<br />
Is here and now<br />
To do what is possible this moment now<br />
Not wait for the perfect weather, time, clothes<br />
Just do it now!<br />
Quickly<br />
Tick it off<br />
Things you want to say<br />
Skills you want to learn<br />
Stories you want to share<br />
And tell the world<br />
Finish your paintings<br />
Do your dancing<br />
Marry your soulmate<br />
Don‚Äôt you waste time<br />
<br />
Focus on what is important<br />
Conserve your energy for meaningful things in life<br />
The secret is to give<br />
And not take<br />
<br />
Travel light through the journey of life<br />
So you can hop off anytime you are asked to<br />
Why carry the burdens<br />
Of being a victim<br />
Shed off the perception<br />
That you thought<br />
What others were thinking<br />
Because others were too immersed<br />
In their own little dreams<br />
To judge you and say mean things.<br />
<br />
Shake it off and walk away!<br />
For there is no time to waste<br />
The virus may strike any day!<br />
<br />
