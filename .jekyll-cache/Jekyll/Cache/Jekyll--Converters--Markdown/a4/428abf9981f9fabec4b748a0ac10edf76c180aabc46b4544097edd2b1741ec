I"<p>27th March 2020</p>

<p>There are some days when I feel surrounded by a lower vibration thought. Now i recognise it because i have had it before, many times before in my life. I feel unhappy with everything when that happens with my job, with myself, with my city, with the country that i live in.</p>

<p>After speaking to a friend whom i share my thinking on spirituality and have shared my positive days when i have felt very vibrant and fulfilled, I start to feel better. My friend reminds me that i am slowly giving too much space to the negative thoughts. I must create space for the positive thoughts and remind myself of all the challenges i have overcome and how happy i have felt. Prayer is a way that gives us strength to find the strength to do that. She tells me that. I have done that before.  So i decide to go back to my routine of a silent prayer asking for guidance.</p>

<p>In the prayer i realise that,” I am so grateful to be where I am today, with my family, friends, acquaintances. “I have enjoyed a good rapport with my team in my previous job. I stayed like that for at least 2 yrs before it got bad. This will happen very often.</p>

<p>Having a belief in the Universal energy, who looks after me and the presence of this energy, i feel very often. It makes me feel empowered . My self Belief increases. I do not need approval from other people then. I am quite happy in my space. I say to myself” I am where I am meant to be, doing what i was meant for”</p>

<p>Near death Experiences teach me the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Death is not as scary it looks.</li>
</ol>

<p>\    2.  At the moment of death you are not alone. You are always supported. You do not feel any pain. You feel loved.                     so much so that you do not want to come back.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I feel empowered that i should use my life to do something worthwhile which will help others in their journey. Everyday is an opportunity for me to be kind, to make someone happy. I have had such magical moments of joy with the kids in my current job as an Educator. I have felt loved. The kids have felt loved and we have been connected.</li>
  <li>Everyone who has experienced NDE has felt unconditional love, warmth and felt safe ,protected and rested like in a mothers womb.</li>
  <li>When I was 16, I felt very unwell one night. By next day I was in a Coma. I had walked down one floor with my brother, gone to my grand mothers bed, hugged her, holding her hand i had drifted off to sleep. My mum told me that I had convulsions and i was very strongly pushing away people and two people had to hold me. Well, I was not at all conscious of anything. I woke up three day later in the hospital and demanded hot water from my mother so I could have a bath and go to the library.</li>
  <li>
    <p>After reading Brian Weiss’s book “ Many Lives Many Masters”, I understood that we will never be separated from our loved ones. We will be born again together!</p>

    <p>Do you know where you were before being born? No ?</p>

    <p>Well there are many things we don’t know, but that does not mean that they do not exist. Why do we need proof of everything. It is a feeling, an experience. I am a spiritual person. I have felt the presence of source energy in my life! I have awakened to the beautiful experience of feeling connected to the universe. We are all in it together! I am so grateful for having so many wonderful people in my life! I could not have imagined a better experience and better learning !</p>
